# Authentication Design
## Auth Architecture
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant S as Server
    participant DB as Database

    Note over U, S: Registration Process
    U->>S: Sends registration data
    S->>DB: Stores user credentials
    DB-->>S: Confirms user is created
    S-->>U: Returns success message

    Note over U, S: Login Process
    U->>S: Sends login credentials
    S->>DB: Validates credentials
    DB-->>S: Returns validation result
    alt Credentials are valid
        S->>S: Generates JWT
        S-->>U: Returns JWT
    else Credentials are invalid
        S-->>U: Returns error
    end
```



## Implementation
To implement JWT functionality, especially in the context of a web application using a middleware approach, is a common and effective strategy. The middleware will intercept incoming requests, extract and validate the JWT, and then either allow the request to proceed to the next stage or reject it if the token is invalid.

### Explanation

1. **User Registration and Login**:
   - During registration, user details are stored in the database, and upon successful login, a JWT is generated and sent back to the user.
   - The JWT typically includes a payload with user information and a signature to ensure its authenticity.

2. **JWT Middleware**:
   - The JWT middleware is a function that runs between the incoming request and the route handler.
   - It checks for the presence of a JWT in the request headers and validates it.
   - If the token is valid, the middleware sets the user context for the request and passes control to the next handler.
   - If the token is invalid (expired, tampered with, etc.), the middleware stops the request, and an error response is sent back to the client.

3. **Protected Routes**:
   - Only requests with a valid JWT can access protected routes. If the JWT is missing or invalid, the middleware prevents access.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Install JWT Library**: Use a JWT library suitable for your programming language and framework.
2. **Generate JWT on Login**: After validating user credentials during the login process, generate a JWT and send it to the client.
3. **Create Middleware Function**:
   - Extract the JWT from the request headers.
   - Validate the JWT using the secret key used to sign the token.
   - If valid, allow the request to proceed; if not, return an error response.
4. **Apply Middleware to Protected Routes**: Configure your application routes to use the JWT middleware for any route that requires authentication.

### Mermaid Diagram

Hereâ€™s a Mermaid diagram to illustrate the JWT process with middleware:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as Client
    participant Server as Server
    participant Middleware as JWT Middleware
    participant RouteHandler as Route Handler

    Client->>Server: Request (with JWT in header)
    activate Server
    Server->>Middleware: Validate JWT
    activate Middleware

    alt JWT is valid
        Middleware->>RouteHandler: Proceed to Route Handler
        activate RouteHandler
        RouteHandler->>Server: Process request & generate response
        deactivate RouteHandler
    else JWT is invalid
        Middleware-->>Server: Return Error
    end

    deactivate Middleware
    Server-->>Client: Response (200 OK or 401 Unauthorized)
    deactivate Server
```

In this diagram:

- **Client**: Sends requests to the server and receives responses. The client stores and includes the JWT in the headers of requests to protected routes.
- **Server**: The main application server that receives all requests.
- **JWT Middleware**: Intercepts requests, checks and validates the JWT.
- **Route Handler**: The final destination of the request if the JWT is valid, where actual business logic is processed.

By integrating the JWT functionality as middleware, you create a centralized and consistent way to handle authentication across your application, making the codebase cleaner and more maintainable.
